                    hands-on learning experiences that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge 
                    from my BE program to real-world scenarios.This practical approach was instrumental 
                    in deepening my understanding of engineering concepts.

                                As a graphic designer,I find inspiration in the strategic elegance of chess and the dynamic precision of badminton. 
                                Just as in chess, where every move carries weight and purpose, my design approach revolves around every pixel, color, and 
                                element serving a strategic purpose. I bring the same dedication and focus to my work as I do to the chessboard, 
                                ensuring that each design choice is a calculated move towards achieving a visually stunning and effective result. 
                                Badminton, on the other hand, has taught me the importance of agility and adaptability, 
                                skills that are equally vital in the ever-evolving landscape of graphic design. 
                                Whether I'm crafting a sleek logo or designing a captivating website, 
                                I approach each project with the same enthusiasm and agility that I bring to the badminton court. Through this portfolio, 
                                I invite you to explore the synergy of my passions and witness how they harmonize to create compelling and visually engaging design solutions.<
