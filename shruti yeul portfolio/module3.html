        <h2>LASER CUTTING</h2>
        <p>Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. 
            While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses, 
            architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics.
            The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material.
            A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. 
            The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] 
            leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish </p>
